## Introduction

Welcome to my 8086 Assembly Language Problem Solving Repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various problems implemented using the Intel 8086 microprocessor's assembly language.

As an enthusiast of low-level programming and computer architecture, I've been honing my skills in Assembly language programming on the 8086 microprocessor. This repository serves as a showcase of my problem-solving abilities and understanding of Assembly language concepts.

## About Assembly Language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is specific to a particular computer architecture. Programming in assembly language allows for direct manipulation of hardware resources and provides fine-grained control over the processor's operations. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying hardware architecture and offers unparalleled efficiency and optimization capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem solution is organized into its own directory within the repository.
- Each directory contains the Assembly language source code file `.asm` along with any necessary documentation.
- Problem statements or descriptions are provided within the README.md files of each directory for better understanding.

## Problems Solved

The entire repository has been divided into two section:
<br>`Practice Problems`<br>
`Project Works`<br>

Here's a sneak peek at some of the problems I've solved using 8086 Assembly language:

1. Addition of Two Numbers
2. Subtraction of Two Numbers
3. Multiplication of Two Numbers
4. Division of Two Numbers
5. Largest Number in a Set
6. Factorial Calculation
7. Fibonacci Series Generation
8. Palindrome Checker
9. Binary to Decimal Conversion
10. Sorting Algorithms Implementation

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the directory of the problem you're interested in.
3. Open the Assembly language source code file (*.asm) using any text editor or an 8085 Assembly language simulator.
4. Read the problem statement provided in the README.md file.
5. Run the Assembly code using an 8085 emulator or assembler to see the solution in action!
